		<h2>About <em>Page by Page</em></h2>
		<p>Welcome to the homepage of <em><?php echo $subtitle; ?></em>. We are proud to be a part of the <?php echo $title; ?>.</p>
		<p><em><?php echo $subtitle; ?></em> has begun collecting data on the books found in the House of the Books. Preliminary evidence clearly shows that both residents were prolific readers, collecting a wide range of novels, graphic novels and nonfiction. To date, the details of one bookcase out of 18 is available through this site.</p>

		<p>The following information is available for each book:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Full title.</li>
			<li>Writers' names.</li>
			<li>Publication dates (both of original printing and of the edition represented on the shelf), where available.</li>
			<li>Publisher.</li>
			<li>ISBN 10/ISBN 13, where available.</li>
			<li>Presence of marginalia, where applicable.</li>
			<li>Researcher's notes, commenting on the condition of the book, marginalia, bookmarking and flagging, and any other significant details.</li>
			<li>Tags, to capture subject matter.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The information available for each volume will eventually expand to include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cover images.</li>
			<li>Scans of pages with marginalia, highlighting or underlining, and other significant additions.</li>
			<li>Scans and locations of any items found inserted into volumes or between books.</li>
			<li>Preliminary breakdown of which books belonged to which partner, from handwriting analysis, where available. Where handwriting is not available, a best guess will be made (and indicated as such) from the person's known interests and areas of study.</li>
			<li>Which shelf the book appears on.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>From this information, the project aims to enrich its understanding of how the residents read, how reading affected their interests, how their interests affect their reading, the effect on their thought processes, and where thier reading and interests overlapped and diverged. Combined with their digital footprints, public records, other documentation and personal effects, and examples of each person's writing recovered from various devices found in the house, this will enable a fuller picture of the lives of these two people at this particular time and place.</p>
