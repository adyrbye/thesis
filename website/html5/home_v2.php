			<h2>About the Project</h2>
			<p>The <?php echo $title . ': ' . $subtitle; ?> is the fictional brainchild of Amy Dyrbye, Masters student with the University of Alberta's Humanities Computing program. It is a stand-in for a legitimate web-based academic project, for the purpose of web page testing.</p>
			<h3>About This Page</h3>
			<p>As the <?php echo $title; ?> exists solely to provide web content to work from, this website must be limited in scope. Thus, it consists of a homepage - this page - and the pages required for the bookshelf examination portion of the project (<?php echo $subtitle; ?>). These pages include various listings of the books entered in the database, such as by writer, title or tag, and a set of data entry forms for adding new records.</p>
			<p>The aim of this website is to discover and demonstrate how such a project may be optimized for use on both desktop and tablet computers, by providing material on which to act.</p>
			<h3>The Frame Story</h3>
			<p>In late 2012, a highly localized disaster hit Sherwood Park, Alberta. Interpreted at the time as the first wave of the prophesied Mayan apocalypse, the hamlet's demise was later discovered to be a tragic side effect of the nearby petroleum refineries' recently accelerated production. Soil toxicity remained prohibatively high for the next two centuries, contributing to the dwindling of the nearby city of Edmonton and its remaining affiliated communities.</p> 
			<p>Sherwood Park remained undisturbed until 2267. Though the exact mechanism by which the hamlet's entire western half sunk into the ground has yet to be discovered, the completeness of its submersion combined with the swift desertification of the region has resulted in a remarkable degree of preservation of structures and organics alike. Excavation commenced with the County Hall, spreading North from there. The neighbourhood in which this particular house, dubbed The House of the Books due to the unusually large number of books found within, is situated was particularly well preserved. The House of the Books became a priority focus for study, as it proved to offer a particularly rich slice of the culture of the time even beyond its remarkable literary representation.</p>
			<p>Discovering the Reading Habits of a Suburban Couple is one project of six currently affiliated with the House of the Books and the overarching <?php $title ?>. Together, we piece together an unparalleled picture of life in the early 21st Century.</p>
			<p>Others include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Ghost of You Clings: Lives Revealed Through Everyday Artifacts</li>
				<li>Just What Did They Eat? The Kitchen as a Window to the Past.</li>
				<li>Body of Evidence: The Mummies of the House of the Books</li>
				<li>Digital Footprints: Tracing History via the 21st Century Internet and Recovered Personal Electrontic Devices</li>
				<li>The Work of These Hands: The Practice of Handcrafting in the Early 21st Century, As Evidenced in the House of the Books</li>
			</ul>
